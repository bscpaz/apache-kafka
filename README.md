#### World of events

Everything is an event in a digital modern world. Apache Kafka can deal with a huge throughput of event and it can store they for someone else to consume it.

##### Key points that Kafka answers:
* Where can I save the events?
* How can I quickly (real time) recover each event and send an ACK of reading, even between different systems?
* How can I scale the throughput?
* How can I have resilient and high availability?
* How can I guarantee no messages losses?
